### Adapted partially from [Bug Ninza](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIf9KeakswM) but includes my own modifications of existing features + inclusion of various additional features:
- [x] Display all user button presses (Both numbers and operations) in secondary display before pressing = for result
- [x] Insert dark mode/light mode icon at Switch
- [x] Basic 2 number ops: When  you press an operation make sure first number does NOT yet disappear (Keep displayed)
- [x] Add additional local state to capture all history of numbers and math ops before hitting result = 
- [ ] Nudge the Number Label (Misaligned for all numbers to the left)
- [ ] To chain multiple operations in succession continously adding a new number + new math operation
- [ ] When you press each math operation it will calculate so far the result to appear in primary display
- [ ] To highlight current math operation button when next pending number to still be pressed
- [ ] Add logic to (-) button
- [ ] Add logic to (+/-) button
